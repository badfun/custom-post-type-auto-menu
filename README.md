Custom Post Type Auto Menu
=============

A WordPress plugin that automatically adds new custom post type posts to the chosen menu and parent item as a sub-menu item.

Custom Post Type Auto Menu allows the user to choose a custom post type, a menu, and a menu parent item to which new custom post type posts
will be added automatically. This is useful for simplifying things for clients who may not be comfortable adding items to menus. Or
for sites that have a large number of custom post type additions, such as products.

The plugin currently only supports one custom post type.

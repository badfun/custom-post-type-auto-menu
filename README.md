#Custom Post Type Auto Menu
=============

A WordPress plugin that automatically adds new custom post type posts to the chosen menu and parent item as a sub-menu item.

Custom Post Type Auto Menu allows the user to choose a custom post type, a menu, and a menu parent item to which new custom post type posts
will be added automatically. This is useful for simplifying things for clients who may not be comfortable adding items to menus. Or
for sites that have a large number of custom post type additions, such as products.

The plugin is also available in the WordPress plugin repository: http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-auto-menu/


## Installation

1. Upload the plugin to your site and activate.
2. CPT Auto Menus page is now in main admin menu under Settings.
3. Use checkbox to select which Custom Post Types you want an automated menu for, then Save Changes.
4. You will be redirected to Menu Settings tab. Select which menu and which parent menu item where you wish the CPT to display.


## Frequently Asked Questions

1. How many custom post types can I use?
The plugin now supports multiple custom post types. Use as many as you like.

2. Can I create sub-sub menu items?
Yes. But it requires a mod to the code and can lead to strange issues. I'll figure it out for future versions.

3. What about categories and pages?
There are other available solutions for that, but if there is demand I could incorporate it in future releases.

4. Can I add existing custom post type posts to the menu?
Some users have many existing cpt's and want to change them to a new menu. This can be done by selecting all your custom post types
and setting them to 'draft' status, then back to 'publish'. The plugin will detect them as new, and they will be added.

5. Why do post types have to be public?
Custom post types must be set to public for the plugin to see them. This is because one of the assumptions of not setting a post type
to public is that 'show_in_nav_menus' will be false. Obviously this is not the desired outcome of a plugin that automatically adds items
to a menu.

## Known Issues

* Ampersands and other HTML entites in titles can sometimes have curious results, such as multiple menu items.
* Menu items can not have the same name, even if attached to different menus.

Automatically create menu items for your custom post types in your chosen menu and parent menu item.

== Description ==

Custom Post Type Auto Menu allows the user to choose a custom post type, a menu, and a menu parent item to which new custom post type posts
will be added automatically. This simplifies the menu process for users who may not be comfortable adding items to menus, or
for sites that have a large number of custom post type additions, such as products.

The plugin now supports multiple custom post types


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your site and activate.
2. CPT Auto Menus page is now in main admin menu under Settings.
3. Use checkbox to select which Custom Post Types you want an automated menu for, then Save Changes.
4. You will be redirected to Menu Settings tab. Select which menu and which parent menu item where you wish the CPT to display.

== Known Issues ==

* When a custom post type post post has been trashed, it leaves an artifact in the menu. This wasn't happening before 3.8.

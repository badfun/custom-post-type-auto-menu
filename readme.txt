Custom Post Type Auto Menu automatically adds new custom post type posts to the chosen menu and parent item as a sub-menu item.

== Description ==

Custom Post Type Auto Menu allows the user to choose a custom post type, a menu, and a menu parent item to which new custom post type posts
will be added automatically. This simplifies the menu process for users who may not be comfortable adding items to menus, or
for sites that have a large number of custom post type additions, such as products.

The plugin currently only supports one custom post type.


== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your site, then set the custom post type, menu, and menu parent item in 'Settings>CPT Auto Menu'.
